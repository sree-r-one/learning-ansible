# Code Review Findings

## Security Issues

1. **Hard-coded IP Address in backend code**  
   File: `/backend/index.js`  
   The allowedOrigins array contains a hard-coded IP address (206.189.32.244) which shouldn't be in the source code.

2. **Hardcoded Credentials in Ansible Inventory**  
   File: `/ansible/inventory.ini`  
   The inventory file contains a hardcoded IP address and root user, which should be parameterized or stored securely.

3. **Insecure Docker Compose Usage**  
   File: `/ansible/deploy.yml` and `/ansible/provision.yml`  
   Both files run docker-compose as root in the /root directory, which is not a security best practice.

4. **Lack of HTTPS Configuration**  
   The entire application stack has no HTTPS configuration, posing security risks for data transmission.

## Configuration Issues

1. **Inconsistent Environment Configuration**  
   The `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.dev.yml` files have different configurations, which can lead to "works on my machine" issues.

2. **Missing Environment Variable Handling**  
   File: `/frontend/src/App.tsx`  
   There's no fallback for the VITE_API_URL environment variable if it's missing.

3. **Commented-Out Code in Production**  
   File: `/backend/index.js`  
   Contains commented-out code (lines 34-36) which should be removed.

4. **Redundant Ansible Playbooks**  
   Files: `/ansible/setup.yml` and `/ansible/provision.yml`  
   These playbooks contain significant duplicate code which should be refactored.

## Code Quality Issues

1. **Lack of Error Handling**  
   File: `/frontend/src/App.tsx`  
   The fetch error handling only logs to console but could provide better user feedback.

2. **Missing Type Checking**  
   File: `/backend/index.js`  
   The backend is written in plain JavaScript without type checking or JSDoc comments.

3. **Inefficient Docker Build**  
   File: `/frontend/Dockerfile`  
   The COPY . . command copies all files before running npm install, which breaks Docker layer caching.

4. **Missing Terraform Backend Configuration**  
   File: `/terraform/main.tf`  
   No backend configuration for storing Terraform state remotely.

## Infrastructure Issues

1. **Fixed Terraform Region**  
   File: `/terraform/main.tf`  
   Hard-coded region "sgp1" should be a variable for flexibility.

2. **Hard-coded Docker Compose Version**  
   File: `/ansible/setup.yml`  
   The Docker Compose version is hard-coded to 2.24.2 rather than parameterized.

3. **No Health Checks**  
   There are no health checks configured in the Docker Compose files, which affects container reliability.

4. **Inconsistent Docker Build Strategy**  
   The frontend uses a multi-stage build for production but the backend doesn't, leading to inconsistent deployment practices.

## Recommendations

1. Use environment variables for all configuration values and secrets
2. Implement HTTPS for all services
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Standardize deployment practices across services
5. Implement health checks for containers
6. Refactor duplicated Ansible code into reusable roles
7. Add proper logging and monitoring solutions
8. Implement proper container security practices
9. Use a remote Terraform backend to store state
10. Add proper documentation for deployment and development
